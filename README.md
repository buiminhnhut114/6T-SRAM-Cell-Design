# 6T-SRAM-Cell-Design

## Repository for the design and implementation of a 6T SRAM cell using Synopsys tools and 90nm technology.

### Introduction
This repository contains the documents, source code, and simulation results for the project "Analog Design and Implementation of a 6T SRAM Cell" using Synopsys tools and 90nm technology. This project is a collaborative effort of team members under the curriculum of the University of Sciences, National University of Ho Chi Minh City.

### Project Objectives
The aim of this project is to design and implement a 6T SRAM cell, optimizing it for high performance and low power consumption in memory chip production. This process involves steps from schematic design, pre-layout simulation, layout creation, DRC/LVS checks, and post-layout simulation.

### Directory Structure
- `/docs`: Project reports, documentation, and meeting minutes.
- `/src`: Source files for the designs and simulations.
- `/tests`: Test scripts and simulation results.
- `/images`: Storage for schematic diagrams and layout images.
- `/references`: Reference documents and papers.

### Technology and Tools
- **Synopsys Custom Designer**: Used for schematic design and layout.
- **Synopsys PrimeWave**: Utilized for simulation setups.
- **90nm CMOS Technology**: The technology node used for the design and implementation.
